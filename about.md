The purpose of this project is to study the impact of the internet  on marriage and  family relationships.
More specially, we will focus on the use of social networks such as  Facebook, Twitter and Tinder. 
We will explore the  correlation between the usage of these social media mediums and marial status of couples.
This will include the marriages done through social media and the usage of social media throughout the marriages. 
Initially we will present results only about the USA. 
Provided that we have access to the relevant data, we may evaluate Turkey as well.
