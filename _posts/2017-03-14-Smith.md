This report is the first of the two reports on social media and relationships published by Pew Research Center in 2013. 
We briefly evaluated the second report "Couples, the Internet, and Social Media" in a [previous post] (https://hasanbalci.github.io/CS513/research%20report/2017/03/07/Lenhard/). 

The report tries to show the general attitude of American people on use of dating sites and apps by presenting statistical values. 
It also analyzes the change on this attitute by comparing the results with a 2005 survey done on the same topic. 

Some highlights from the report:

> + Attitudes towards online dating are becoming more positive over time.
> + Using the internet to flirt, research potential partners, and check up on old flames have all become much more common in recent years.
> + Negative experiences on online dating sites are relatively common.
> + Social networking sites offer a new online venue for navigating the world of dating and relationships.

This report contains many statistical data related to the use and effect of the online dating sites and apps that we can use in our term paper.
