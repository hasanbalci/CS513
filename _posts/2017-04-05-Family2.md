This writing answers the question how I can understand whether the social media has negative impact on my marriage or not. 

The answer can be summarized as follows:

+ Your marriage needs to be your most important relationship. If you sense that this is not the case, then you need to stop and evaluate your situation.

+ You need to look at whether you spend more time on social media than interacting with your spouse.

+ You need to be sure that the content shared on the social media is not disturbing both side. 

+ Do you feel a sudden compulsion to log off or minimize the Facebook window when your spouse walks into the room unannounced? 

+ You need to ask yourself about your interactions with online acquaintances and "friends," especially those of the opposite sex. 
Do your conversations include things that should be kept between you and your spouse? 

Writing suggests that If any of these danger signals are present in your marriage and your use of social media, 
you need to sit down with your spouse and take a very close look at your situation.
