Finally I got a chance to play with Docker and was pretty satisfied with
the experience. There are some rough edges, but it didn't lessen my excitement.
Docker is stable for a few months, currently the latest version is 1.2.

I will try to use Docker to run different versions of MySQL and PostgreSQL for
testing purposes at [Datazenit](https://datazenit.com). Docker was pretty easy to
setup both on my development MacBook and on a Linux server. Docker offers a
nice, official package for OSX that installs all dependencies, including,
VirtualBox. [An interactive tutorial](https://docker.com/tryit/) can be found on Docker website, and it
covers all core aspects of Docker.
